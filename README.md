# The-Tower
A game I made using JavaScript to practice programming!

# Gameplay

## Basics
Every level is a randomly generated maze containing:
- the player (blue)
- the goal (green)
- 3 chests (yellow)
- 3 enemies (red)

Make sure you have the console open so you can see information related to the game!

## Controls
Use the arrow keys to move through the maze
Use the ENTER key to interact with the space you're on

You can only see one space ahead in each direction there is no wall
Once you see a space, it remains visible

## Advancing
Your goal is to reach floor 100 and defeat the final boss (not finished lol)
Each floor, you should try to reach the green square and advance by interacting with it (hit ENTER)

## Chests
These contain gold you can use to buy items at shops (not finished lol)
Collect gold by standing on chest and interacting (hit ENTER)

## Enemies
These are spaces that once you step on, you cannot leave until you defeat the enemy
You start battle by interacting (hit ENTER)
Each turn, you and the enemy will both attack each other and do damage
If you defeat the enemy, you will get gold
